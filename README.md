# Project Restful Dogs

A student that completes this project shows that they can:
* troubleshoot running services using both system and programmatically generated logs
* implement server sided routing and rendering for a Spring REST service
* implement industry standard exception handling including user friendly exception messages

# Introduction

We worked with dogs in plain Java. This project returns dog data using Rest APIs with appropriate exception handling, logging, and make use of Server Side Rendering.

# Instructions

Deploy java-dogs to Heroku
  * Specifically check to see if Message Queues are working
  * If that are NOT, disable the use of RabbitMQ
    * This is straight forward - should be commenting out a few lines. If you are deleting signaficant amounts of code, you are on the wrong track!
